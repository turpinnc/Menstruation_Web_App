What the project does-- This repo looks at a dataset involing SAT scores from 1967 to 2001. It breaks them down into male, female, and all students. It further breaks them down into verbal, math, and combined verbal and math. Descriptive analysis was done on the data and key visualizations were made to understand the data at a preliminary level. No insights or findings were declared or deduced. This project includes the csv, a python script, and the jupyter notebook. 

Why the project is useful-- This project is useful because findings and insights can be made to understand scores depending on the year, subject, and gender. This can be further studied to understand education, academics, and high schoolers at the time of the scores.
